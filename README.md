# cdm-test-generated-python

This repo includes unit tests for Python generated from Rosetta to support CDM.  These perform three types of tests: semantics, serialization, and a test for the "->" operator.

run_tests.sh runs the tests after installing all the relevant packages including the Rosetta Runtime and the generated Python CDM packages.  These two default to versions included in the repo. 

To test a different version of the package, update the script accordingly.
